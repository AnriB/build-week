				<b>Queen</b> are a British rock band formed in London in 1970. Their
				classic line-up was Freddie Mercury (lead vocals, piano), Brian May
				(guitar, vocals), Roger Taylor (drums, vocals) and John Deacon (bass).
				Their earliest works were influenced by progressive rock, hard rock and
				heavy metal, but the band gradually ventured into more conventional and
				radio-friendly works by incorporating further styles, such as arena rock
				and pop rock.
			</p>

				Before forming Queen, May and Taylor had played together in the band
				Smile. Mercury was a fan of Smile and encouraged them to experiment with
				more elaborate stage and recording techniques. He joined in 1970 and
				suggested the name "Queen". Deacon was recruited in February 1971,
				before the band released their eponymous debut album in 1973. Queen
				first charted in the UK with their second album, Queen II, in 1974.
				Sheer Heart Attack later that year and A Night at the Opera in 1975
				brought them international success. The latter featured "Bohemian
				Rhapsody", which stayed at number one in the UK for nine weeks and
				helped popularise the music video format.
			</p>

				The band's 1977 album News of the World contained "We Will Rock You" and
				"We Are the Champions", which have become anthems at sporting events. By
				the early 1980s, Queen were one of the biggest stadium rock bands in the
				world. "Another One Bites the Dust" from The Game (1980) became their
				best-selling single, while their 1981 compilation album Greatest Hits is
				the best-selling album in the UK and is certified eight times platinum
				in the US. Their performance at the 1985 Live Aid concert is ranked
				among the greatest in rock history by various publications. In August
				1986, Mercury gave his last performance with Queen at Knebworth,
				England. In 1991, he died of bronchopneumonia—a complication of AIDS—and
				Deacon retired in 1997. Since 2004, May and Taylor have toured under the
				"Queen +" name with vocalists Paul Rodgers and Adam Lambert. Estimates
				of Queen's record sales range from 170 million to 300 million records,
				making them one of the world's best-selling music artists. In 1990,
				Queen received the Brit Award for Outstanding Contribution to British
				Music from the British Phonographic Industry. They were inducted into
				the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2001. Each member has composed hit
				singles, and all four were inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in
				2003. In 2005, Queen received the Ivor Novello Award for Outstanding
				Song Collection from the British Academy of Songwriters, Composers, and
				Authors. In 2018, they were presented the Grammy Lifetime Achievement
				Award.
